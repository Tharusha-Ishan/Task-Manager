## App Description
This is a simple app to help you manage your daily tasks. You can add new tasks with a title and description. If you finish a task, you can check it off to mark it as done. You can also edit a task if you made a mistake or want to change something. If you don't need a task anymore, you can delete it easily. The app saves your tasks automatically so they are still there when you open the app again.

## Design Choices
I made the app simple so anyone can use it easily.

*   **Colors**: I picked standard colors that look nice and are easy to read on the screen.
*   **Layout**: The list shows all your tasks clearly in one place. The "Add" button is floating at the bottom so it is always easy to find.
*   **Storage**: I used `SharedPreferences` to save the tasks. This is a simple way to store data on the phone quickly.
*   **Code Structure**: I organized the code into different files (Activities, Adapters, Models) to keep it clean and easy to understand.
